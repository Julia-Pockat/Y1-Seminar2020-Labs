# Lists Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to start writing AND using **lists**, to start and get a sense on where and when to use them!

## Instructions:
> Before we start, make sure to create a new **Repl.it** and call it **"Day 5"**!  
> In **"Day 5"**, edit `main.py` in order to do the lab.


### 1) Warm Up!
1. *Create* a new list and call it `classmates`, and include all of the classmates you see around you in that list!
    - Example: `classmates = ["Loai", "Ahmad", "Celina", "Lyel", "Malak", "Shir"]`

2. Add your name to the list, using the `append()` function!

3. Let a partner make sure it's correct!


### 2) Parking Valet!

You're working as a valet tonight at a restaurant! But, since you're a clever programmer, you decide to write a program that does your work for the night!  

1. *Define* a new list and call it `parked_cars`.
    - It should start as an empty list!

2. *Define* a new function called `park`, it should take 1 argument - `car`

3. `park` function should add the `car` to the `parked_cars` list!
    - And print `"Parked [car] in the garage!"`
    
4. *Define* a new function called `getMyCar`, it should take 1 argument - `car`
    - The function should remove the `car` from `parked_cars` list!
    - And print `"[car] is out of the garage and ready for use!"`


### 3) Netflix!

Sometimes it's hard to keep up with your **Netflix *movie queue***. Sometimes, all you need is a Friday night to binge watch Friends.

We're going to use lists to manipulate our own movie Queue.


1. *Define* a new variable, it should be a list.
    - Ask your partner/family member to give you a list of his/her 5 favorite movies/tv shows.
    - Name the variable according to your partner/family member. For example: "loais_queue"

2. *Define* a function `first_movie` that returns the first movie in the queue. 
    - This function should accept a list as an argument ( `movie_queue`).


3. *Define* a function `watch_movie` that deletes the first movie in the list and returns the updated list.
    - This function should accept a list as an argument (`movie_queue`).

4. *Define* a function `update_queue` that returns the updated list. 
    - This function takes **two** arguments:
        1. `movie_queue` - the list of movies.
        2. `movie` - the movie you want to add to the queue.
