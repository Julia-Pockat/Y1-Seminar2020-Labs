## Instructions:

### 1) Setting up Repl.it:
Please use [this document](https://github.com/meet-projects/Y1-Seminar2020/blob/master/replit-setup.md) as your guide to setting up your Repl.it environment.


### 2) Your first lines of code!

1. Copy this code to your `Repl`, and follow the instructions written inside *(1,2 & 3)*:
    ```python
    # 1. Run this program by clicking on the green "run" button above.
    # 2. Analyze the lines below, guess what it does.

    print("MEET Seminar is fun!")
    print("Python as well!")


    # 3. Try to perform an action(s) of your own, just like the lines.
    ```
    - Try to identify what does each of the following mean:
        - `#` - a hashtag.
        - `print("some text")`

### 3) Printing dynamic text!
1. Copy this code to your `Repl`, and follow the instructions below it:
    ```python
    name = "Loai"
    print(name + " is super pumped about being a MEET student!")
    ```
    - Try to analyze and understand what happened here.
    - Create your own dynamic sentence!
    - Try to add another word, so your sentence would have 2 dynamic elements!

## Bonus:


### 1) User Interaction!
1. Copy this code to your `Repl`, and follow the instructions below it:
    ```python
    name = input("Please write your name: ")
    print(name + " is being an awesome coder right now!")
    ```
    - Run this program, try to analyze and understand what happened here.
    - Create your own dynamic sentence!
    - Try to add another word, so your sentence would have 2 dynamic elements given by the user!
